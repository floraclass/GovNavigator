# GovNavigator

A blockchain-based platform for transparent and accessible government service information, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Problem Statement

Citizens often struggle to navigate complex government bureaucracy:

- Information about services is scattered across different websites and offices
- Requirements and procedures are often unclear or outdated
- Citizens waste time and resources trying to access basic services
- Rural and underserved populations face additional barriers to information

## Solution

GovNavigator provides a decentralized, transparent platform for government service information:

- Comprehensive directory of government services with clear steps and requirements
- Verified information from authorized government agencies
- User ratings and feedback to improve service quality
- Accessible through multiple channels (web, WhatsApp, SMS)
- Immutable record of service information on the Stacks blockchain

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Features

- **Service Directory**: Store and retrieve information about government services
- **Categorization**: Organize services by type (ID documents, business registration, etc.)
- **Rating System**: Allow citizens to rate services and provide feedback
- **Admin Controls**: Authorized government agencies can update service information
- **Transparency**: All changes to service information are recorded on the blockchain

### Architecture

The system consists of:

1. **Clarity Smart Contract**: Core data storage and business logic
2. **Frontend Application**: User interface for citizens to access information
3. **Admin Dashboard**: For government agencies to update service information
4. **API Layer**: For integration with messaging platforms (WhatsApp, SMS)

## Setup Instructions

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Government Service

```plaintext
(contract-call? .gov-navigator add-service 
  "Passport Application" 
  "Apply for a new passport or renew an existing one" 
  "1. Valid ID\n2. Birth certificate\n3. Passport photos\n4. Application fee" 
  "1. Complete online form\n2. Schedule appointment\n3. Submit documents\n4. Pay fee\n5. Collect passport" 
  "Immigration Office: +123-456-7890, passport@gov.example" 
  "Identity Documents"
)
```

### Retrieving Service Information

```plaintext
(contract-call? .gov-navigator get-service u1)
```
